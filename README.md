# NEOqwertz #
This repo only contains one script for opening an [overview](./neo_gesamt.png) of the [NEOqwertz layout](https://www.neo-layout.org/Layouts/neoqwertz/) and closing it automatically.

Using the script in combination with a global keyboard shortcut like STRG+Ã– is quite handy for fast searching all layers, especially if you start learning the layout (which I highly recommend).
